<h4>Hello World!</h4>
  The words flashed back at me from the screen. It had only taken a thousand times
with a thousand "syntax errors" and "undefined variables" and even the occassional
"missing file" but it was finally over. Those sweet yet terrifying words were like
a saving angel but the road had been lined with devels. Finally, through all of
the trouble, the very first assignment of my python scripting class was complete.
My phone's alert appears in my visor. The one thing I hated about my old hand-me-down
visor was that it only told me that I had an alert. Some of the newer visors showed
the message even if it was a 3GB video. Even the visors from 10 years showed parts
of the message but my old relic couldn't even think about showing that.
  The only way that I would be able to see the alert would be to pull my even older
of a relic phone out and look at it. My old Iphone 10 was so big and bulky. The teacher
was sure see it. I didn't know what to do.
