  <p>This website is planned to be an evergrowing arcade of games.
  These games will all be programmed by Ryker McKnight (Myself).
  I hope that all people old or young, big or small, may be able
  to find happiness at Quinticade.

<p>Throughout programming this website, I've been able to reflect my
abilities to code. I learned that the more ambishous the dream, the better
the final product will look. Html, or as some call it, Hyper Text Markup Language,
was an enormous instrument in creating this website. Css, or Casscading StyleSheets
also played a huge role in the development of this product. Finally, Javascript,
whenever I programmed in Javascript, it took me home. Back to programming in my
first language, Python. Of course there were a lot of bumps in the road and there will
be many more to come. Stay strong, don't give up.</p>
